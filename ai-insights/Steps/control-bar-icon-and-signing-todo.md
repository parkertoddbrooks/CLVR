# Todo List for Control Bar Icon, Code Signing, and Notarization

## Control Bar Icon Implementation
1. Research macOS control bar icon implementation (NSStatusItem)
2. Design icon for both active and inactive states
3. Implement toggle functionality for the icon
4. Add menu items for additional actions (e.g., open settings, quit app)
5. Integrate icon functionality with existing DuplicateFileManager.sh script
6. Test icon visibility and functionality across different macOS versions
7. Update user documentation to include information about the control bar icon

## Code Signing
1. Obtain an Apple Developer ID certificate
2. Research best practices for code signing macOS applications
3. Implement code signing process in the build script
4. Test signed application on different macOS versions
5. Update developer documentation with code signing instructions

## Notarization
1. Research Apple's notarization requirements and process
2. Set up notarization in Xcode or using command-line tools
3. Implement notarization step in the build process
4. Test notarized application distribution and installation
5. Update developer documentation with notarization instructions

## General Tasks
1. Update the PRD (Product Requirements Document) to include control bar icon, code signing, and notarization requirements
2. Revise the project roadmap to include these new features
3. Update the README and other relevant documentation to reflect the new features and requirements
4. Plan for potential user communication about the updates (e.g., changelog, release notes)

## Testing and Quality Assurance
1. Develop test cases for control bar icon functionality
2. Create a testing protocol for signed and notarized application versions
3. Perform compatibility testing on various macOS versions
4. Conduct user acceptance testing for the new control bar icon feature

## Future Considerations
1. Explore automatic update functionality for the application
2. Consider implementing a more robust settings interface accessible from the control bar icon
3. Investigate potential for cross-platform compatibility (if desired)

Note: This todo list serves as a starting point. Each item may need to be broken down into more detailed tasks as implementation begins.
