# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Development Log - 2024-09-04

## Project Summary
The DuplicateFileUpdater is a macOS menu bar application developed in Swift using AppKit. Its primary function is to automatically rename duplicate files in the user's Desktop and Documents folders by appending a timestamp to the filename. The project aims to replicate and improve upon the functionality of an existing shell script while providing a user-friendly interface.

## Interaction Summary
The interaction focused on resolving a critical issue where the app could access the Desktop folder but not the Documents folder due to sandboxing restrictions. The developer and AI assistant collaborated to implement a solution using security-scoped bookmarks for the Documents folder while maintaining the existing approach for the Desktop folder.

## Development Summary
1. Identified the root cause of the Documents folder access issue in the sandboxed environment.
2. Implemented security-scoped bookmarks for the Documents folder.
3. Updated the `getWatchedPaths()` function to use the bookmark for Documents and the standard FileManager for Desktop.
4. Modified the permission request process to handle both Desktop and Documents folders.
5. Implemented proper resource management for security-scoped bookmarks.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing with various file scenarios in both Desktop and Documents folders.
2. Enhance error handling, especially for stale bookmarks or revoked permissions.
3. Improve user feedback mechanisms for folder access and file watching status.
4. Perform performance optimization, particularly for handling large numbers of files.
5. Update project documentation to reflect recent changes.
6. Consider incrementing the app's version number.

## Challenges
1. Navigating the complexities of macOS sandboxing and file system access.
2. Balancing the need for security with the requirement for broad file system access.
3. Implementing a solution that works for both Desktop and Documents folders despite different access methods.

## Lessons Learned
1. The importance of understanding macOS sandboxing and its implications on file system access.
2. The value of security-scoped bookmarks for maintaining file access in sandboxed environments.
3. The need for different approaches to file access depending on the folder and system configuration.

## Insights Gained
1. macOS may handle Desktop folder access differently (possibly through symlinks or aliases) even in sandboxed environments.
2. Security-scoped bookmarks provide a robust method for maintaining file access across app launches.
3. Careful management of security-scoped resources is crucial for proper app behavior.

## Decisions Made
1. To use security-scoped bookmarks for the Documents folder while maintaining the existing approach for the Desktop folder.
2. To request permission for both Desktop and Documents folders, even though only Documents required special handling.
3. To store the Documents folder bookmark in UserDefaults for persistence across app launches.

## Trade-offs Made
1. Increased code complexity in exchange for proper sandboxed operation.
2. Additional user interaction (folder selection) for improved security and system compliance.

## Risks Taken
1. Relying on the current Desktop folder access method, which may change in future macOS versions.
2. Storing security-scoped bookmarks in UserDefaults, which could potentially be tampered with.

## Assumptions Made
1. The current Desktop folder access method will continue to work in future macOS versions.
2. Users will be willing to grant folder access permissions for the app to function.
3. The security-scoped bookmark approach will remain a valid method for file access in sandboxed environments.

## Constraints
1. macOS sandboxing rules and restrictions.
2. The need to maintain compatibility with the original shell script functionality.
3. Limited ability to access system folders without explicit user permission.

## Dependencies
1. Swift and AppKit for application development.
2. macOS security and sandboxing frameworks.
3. UserDefaults for storing persistent data (bookmarks).

## Final Trade-offs
1. User experience (requiring folder selection) vs. security and system compliance.
2. Code simplicity vs. robust file system access in a sandboxed environment.
3. Broad file system access vs. adherence to Apple's security guidelines.
