- moving file renames
- if ' copy' exits, or ' copy 2' exists, ap pwont' rename
- make version without -copy_ in the name
- connect to settings panel





---

old, and done: 

- change the name of the project to "CLVR" in all locations
- document all code
- add a settings window
  - quit on/off
  - copy on/off
  - timestamp formatting
  
  

Can we make a settings window that looks like the one attached - let's not worry about the connected funtionality for now. let's just get the UI sorted.

1. Put 'Settings... in the menu bar under About [ ] CLVR
2. Then make a settings window that looks like the one attached.

Here isthe Settings window copy: 

Title:
{⌘} CLVR (REPLACE Keyboard)

Items: 

(REPLACE Keyboard Navigaiton)
Line (big text): Show in Dock then: (on/off toggle))
Line (small text): App will appear in the Dock, Switcher, and 'Force Quit Applications'

(REPLACE Keyboard Navigaiton)
Line (big text): Show in Menu Bar then: (on/off toggle)
Line (small text): If off, 'Show in Dock' must be on

(REPLACE Microphone source)
Big Text: Date Format Then: (dropdown)

Dropdown:
  - orginal-name-copy-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss (default)
  - orginal-name-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss
  - orginal-name-copy-yyyy-dd-MM-HHmmss
  - orginal-name-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss




Apple Title window (the menu next to the Apple logo on the top left of the screen)
 - About {⌘} CLVR
 - Bar
 - Settings..
 - Bar
 - Quit {⌘} CLVR + ⌘Q



Logic
 - if Menu Bar (off), then show in Dock should change to (on)
 - If Show in Dock (on), move About CLVR to App Title in Menu Bar.
 - Settings.. should appear in App Menu
 - Settings.. should always appear in Menu Bar (even if Show in Dock is on)
 - If Show in Dock (on), ⌘Q should be on in menu bar after 'Quit'
 - If Show in Dock (off), ⌘Q should NOT be on in menu bar after 'Quit' (this is currently true)
