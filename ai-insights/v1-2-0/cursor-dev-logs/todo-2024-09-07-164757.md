- moving file renames
- if ' copy' exits, or ' copy 2' exists, ap pwont' rename
- make version without -copy_ in the name
- connect to settings panel

Things to look at: 

I've examined the code, and here's my feedback:

Positive aspects:
1. The code is well-structured and organized into logical sections.
2. There's extensive use of documentation comments, which is excellent for maintainability.
3. The app delegate handles various responsibilities, including menu bar management, file system watching, and settings management.
4. Error handling and logging are implemented throughout the code.
5. The code uses modern Swift features and follows many best practices.

Areas for improvement:
1. Separation of Concerns: The AppDelegate class is quite large and handles many different responsibilities. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused classes or structs.

2. Use of Optionals: There are several force-unwrapped optionals (`!`) in the code. While some might be necessary, it's worth reviewing each case to see if they can be safely unwrapped or handled differently.

3. File System Watcher: The `FileSystemWatcher` class uses the older C-based API. Consider using the newer `DispatchSource` API for file system events, which is more Swift-friendly.

4. Settings Management: The settings window creation and management could be moved to a separate class to reduce the complexity of the AppDelegate.

5. Hardcoded Strings: There are several hardcoded strings throughout the code. Consider using a localization system or at least constants for these strings.

6. Error Handling: While there is error handling, some errors are just logged. Consider how to handle these errors more robustly or present them to the user when appropriate.

7. UI Updates: Some UI updates are done directly on the main thread. While this is often correct, ensure all UI updates are consistently performed on the main thread.

8. File Operations: File operations are performed synchronously. For better performance, especially with larger files, consider using asynchronous file operations.

9. Notification Handling: The notification sending could be abstracted into a separate service for better testability and separation of concerns.

10. Constants: Consider creating a Constants struct or enum to store magic numbers and strings used throughout the code.

Overall, the code is well-written and functional. The main areas for improvement are in code organization and separation of concerns, which would make the codebase more maintainable and easier to test as it grows.

Certainly! Creating unit tests for your existing functionality is a great way to ensure that future updates don't break current features. Here's a step-by-step approach you can take when you're ready to implement unit tests:
1. Set up a test target:
In Xcode, go to File > New > Target
Choose "Unit Testing Bundle"
Name it something like "DuplicateTimestampMenuBarTests"
Identify testable components:
Break down your app into testable units (functions, methods, classes)
Focus on core functionality like file renaming, menu bar interactions, and settings management
Write test cases:
Create a new Swift file for each major component you want to test
Name them descriptively, e.g., "FileRenamerTests.swift", "MenuBarManagerTests.swift"
Structure your tests:
Use XCTest framework
Create a subclass of XCTestCase for each test file
Write individual test methods for specific behaviors
Use setup and teardown methods:
override func setUp() { } for test initialization
override func tearDown() { } for cleanup after tests
Write assertions:
Use XCTAssert functions to verify expected outcomes
Here's an example of what a test file might look like:


import XCTest
@testable import DuplicateTimestampMenuBar

class FileRenamerTests: XCTestCase {

    var fileRenamer: FileRenamer!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        fileRenamer = FileRenamer()
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        fileRenamer = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testShouldRenameFile() {
        XCTAssertTrue(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document copy.txt"))
        XCTAssertFalse(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document.txt"))
        XCTAssertFalse(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document-copy_2023-05-20-123456.txt"))
    }

    func testRenameFile() {
        let originalName = "document copy.txt"
        let newName = fileRenamer.renameFile(originalName)
        XCTAssertTrue(newName.contains("-copy_"))
        XCTAssertTrue(newName.hasSuffix(".txt"))
    }
}

import XCTest
@testable import DuplicateTimestampMenuBar

class FileRenamerTests: XCTestCase {

    var fileRenamer: FileRenamer!

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        fileRenamer = FileRenamer()
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        fileRenamer = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testShouldRenameFile() {
        XCTAssertTrue(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document copy.txt"))
        XCTAssertFalse(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document.txt"))
        XCTAssertFalse(fileRenamer.shouldRenameFile("document-copy_2023-05-20-123456.txt"))
    }

    func testRenameFile() {
        let originalName = "document copy.txt"
        let newName = fileRenamer.renameFile(originalName)
        XCTAssertTrue(newName.contains("-copy_"))
        XCTAssertTrue(newName.hasSuffix(".txt"))
    }
}

old, and done: 

- change the name of the project to "CLVR" in all locations
- document all code
- add a settings window
  - quit on/off
  - copy on/off
  - timestamp formatting
  
  

Can we make a settings window that looks like the one attached - let's not worry about the connected funtionality for now. let's just get the UI sorted.

1. Put 'Settings... in the menu bar under About [ ] CLVR
2. Then make a settings window that looks like the one attached.

Here isthe Settings window copy: 

Title:
{⌘} CLVR (REPLACE Keyboard)

Items: 

(REPLACE Keyboard Navigaiton)
Line (big text): Show in Dock then: (on/off toggle))
Line (small text): App will appear in the Dock, Switcher, and 'Force Quit Applications'

(REPLACE Keyboard Navigaiton)
Line (big text): Show in Menu Bar then: (on/off toggle)
Line (small text): If off, 'Show in Dock' must be on

(REPLACE Microphone source)
Big Text: Date Format Then: (dropdown)

Dropdown:
  - orginal-name-copy-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss (default)
  - orginal-name-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss
  - orginal-name-copy-yyyy-dd-MM-HHmmss
  - orginal-name-yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss




Apple Title window (the menu next to the Apple logo on the top left of the screen)
 - About {⌘} CLVR
 - Bar
 - Settings..
 - Bar
 - Quit {⌘} CLVR + ⌘Q



Logic
 - if Menu Bar (off), then show in Dock should change to (on)
 - If Show in Dock (on), move About CLVR to App Title in Menu Bar.
 - Settings.. should appear in App Menu
 - Settings.. should always appear in Menu Bar (even if Show in Dock is on)
 - If Show in Dock (on), ⌘Q should be on in menu bar after 'Quit'
 - If Show in Dock (off), ⌘Q should NOT be on in menu bar after 'Quit' (this is currently true)
