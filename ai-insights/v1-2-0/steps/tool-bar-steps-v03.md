│  1 Add the menu bar app Xcode project to the _dev_files directory, possibly in a new subdirectory like menu-bar-app/.           
i added it to: /Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-name-with-timestamp-sh/_dev_files/menu-bar-status-switch

make any changes you need.

│  2 Modify the automator-workflow.sh to include steps for installing the menu bar app.                                            yes. 

│  3 Update the clean_and_sign_rsync.sh script to handle the menu bar app alongside the Automator app.                          yes update  clean_and_sign_rsync.sh

But, I will copy to the automator app, and then run to test myself before we clean_and_sign_rsync.sh - this is the last step


│  4 Modify the DMG Canvas project to include the menu bar app in the installer.                                                   you don't need to do anythignh here. I will do all this manually - DuplicateWithTimestamp.app should so everythnig on run

│  5 Update the README-dev-resource-updating-and-creating-DMG.md to include instructions for the menu bar app integration. 
later after we test.
