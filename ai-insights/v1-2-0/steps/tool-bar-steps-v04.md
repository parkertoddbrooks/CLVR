│  1 Review the app's entitlements file to ensure it has the necessary permissions.                                                 │
│  2 Check if the app is correctly using the NSOpenPanel or NSWorkspace.shared.selectFile methods to request access to the Desktop  │
│    and Documents folders.                                                                                                         │
│  3 Implement security-scoped bookmarks to retain access to these folders between app launches.                                    │
│  4 Ensure the app is correctly handling the responses from permission requests before attempting to access the folders.           │
│  5 Review the sandboxing settings in the Xcode project and consider if full sandboxing is necessary for this app's functionality.


│  1 File System Monitoring: Check if the app is correctly setting up file system monitoring for all relevant directories.          │
│  2 Event Detection: Verify if the app is properly detecting file duplication events.                                              │
│  3 File Renaming Logic: Ensure the renaming function is correctly implemented and triggered. 


│  1 Security-scoped bookmarks: We discussed implementing security-scoped bookmarks to retain access to folders between app         │
│    launches. This implementation is missing from the current AppDelegate.swift file.                                              │
│  2 Updated renameFile function: We discussed updates to the renameFile function to fix string literal and regular expression      │
│    issues. These specific changes are not present in the current file.                                                            │
│  3 Error fixes: We talked about resolving issues related to 'name', 'fileExtension', and 'dir' being out of scope, as well as     │
│    contextual type problems for 'caseInsensitive' and 'anchored'. These fixes are not implemented in the current file.            │
│  4 Revised folder access method: We discussed replacing the NSWorkspace.shared.selectFile method with a more robust approach      │
│    using security-scoped bookmarks. This change is not reflected in the current file.                                             │
│
