│  The current AppDelegate.swift file is a basic implementation of a menu bar application for file watching and renaming. However,  │
│  it lacks several crucial features and improvements that we've discussed and implemented in our previous iterations.              │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  ## Missing Features and Improvements                                                                                             │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  1. **Toggle View**: The custom ToggleView class is missing. This view provides a more user-friendly interface for                │
│  enabling/disabling the file watching feature.                                                                                    │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  2. **Automatic Path Detection**: The current implementation still uses FolderAccessManager to request user selection of Desktop  │
│  and Documents folders. We need to implement automatic detection of these folders.                                                │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  3. **FSEventStreamWatcher Improvements**: The current FSEventStreamWatcher class lacks some of the error handling and performan  │
│  improvements we've made.                                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  4. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**: The current implementation has basic logging, but it could be improved with more     │
│  comprehensive error handling and detailed logging.                                                                               │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  5. **Thread Safety**: The current implementation doesn't fully address potential thread safety issues, especially in the FSEven  │
│  callback.                                                                                                                        │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  6. **Performance Optimizations**: The FSEvents stream creation could be optimized for better performance.                        │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  7. **User Notifications**: The current implementation doesn't include user notifications for important events like               │
│  starting/stopping file watching.                                                                                                 │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  8. **Menu Bar Icon Updates**: The menu bar icon doesn't update based on the enabled/disabled state of the file watcher.          │
│                                                                                                                                   │
│  ## Steps to Implement Missing Features                                                                                           │

│     - Create a new ToggleView class that inherits from NSView.                                                                    │
│     - Implement the init method with title, isOn state, target, and action parameters.                                            │
│     - Add NSTextField for the title and NSSwitch for the toggle.                                                                  │
│                                                                                                                                   │

│     - Remove FolderAccessManager.                                                                                                 │
│     - Use FileManager.default.urls(for: .desktopDirectory, in: .userDomainMask) and similar for Documents folder.                 │
│                                                                                                                                   │

│     - Add isWatching flag to prevent multiple start/stop operations.                                                              │
│     - Implement proper error handling in the callback.                                                                            │
│     - Use a dispatch queue for thread-safe operations.                                                                            │

│  - The app is a macOS menu bar application for watching and renaming files.                                                       │
│  - It focuses on the Desktop and Documents folders.                                                                               │
│  - The main feature is to rename files with " copy" suffix or matching a specific timestamp pattern.                              │
│  - The app should provide a toggle in the menu bar to enable/disable file watching.                                               │
│  - Error handling, logging, and user feedback (via notifications) are crucial for a good user experience.                         │
