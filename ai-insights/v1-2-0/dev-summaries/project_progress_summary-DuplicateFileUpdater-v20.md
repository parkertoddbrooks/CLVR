# Duplicate File Updater - Project Progress Summary (v20)

## Overview
In this version, we've transitioned the Duplicate File Updater from a command-line tool to a macOS menu bar application. This change provides a more user-friendly interface and easier access to the file duplication and timestamp functionality.

## Key Changes and Features

### 1. Menu Bar Integration
- Implemented a menu bar item with a custom icon ('doc.on.doc') for quick access to the application.
- The menu bar item opens a dropdown menu when clicked.

### 2. User Interface
- Created a custom dropdown menu with the following items:
  - 'Duplicate + Timestamp' toggle switch
  - Separator
  - 'Quit' option

### 3. Toggle Functionality
- Implemented a custom ToggleView class to create a menu item with a toggle switch.
- The 'Duplicate + Timestamp' option can be toggled on/off using this switch.

### 4. AppKit Implementation
- Transitioned from SwiftUI to AppKit for better control over the menu bar functionality.
- Utilized NSStatusItem, NSMenu, and custom NSView subclasses for the UI components.

### 5. App Behavior
- Ensured the application runs as a true menu bar app without appearing in the Dock.
- Implemented a method to hide the app from the Dock using NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory).

### 6. Code Structure
- Created an AppDelegate class to manage the application's lifecycle and menu bar functionality.
- Separated the ToggleView into its own class for better code organization.

### 7. Functionality Preparation
- Added a placeholder duplicateAndTimestamp() method, ready for future implementation of the file duplication logic.

## Current Status
The application now runs as a fully functional menu bar item with a toggle switch for the 'Duplicate + Timestamp' feature. The UI is in place and behaving correctly, matching the desired appearance and functionality of standard macOS menu bar applications.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the actual file duplication and timestamp logic in the duplicateAndTimestamp() method.
2. Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
3. Implement settings persistence to remember the toggle state between app launches.
4. Consider adding preferences for customizing the timestamp format or other options.
5. Thoroughly test the application on different macOS versions and with various file types.

## Conclusion
This version represents a significant shift in the application's user interface and interaction model. By moving to a menu bar application, we've made the Duplicate File Updater more accessible and user-friendly while maintaining its core functionality. The groundwork is now laid for implementing the actual file operations in future iterations.
