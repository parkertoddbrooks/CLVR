# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Progress Summary - Version 2.3

## Current Status
The DuplicateFileUpdater project has been refactored into a macOS menu bar application using Swift and AppKit. The application now integrates the file duplication and timestamping functionality directly into the Swift code, replacing the previous shell script implementation.

## Key Components
1. AppDelegate: Manages the application's main functionality and menu bar interface.
2. FileSystemWatcher: Handles file system monitoring for new and modified files.
3. ToggleView: Custom view for the menu bar item's toggle switch.

## Recent Changes and Improvements
1. Implemented native Swift file system watching to replace fswatch dependency.
2. Integrated file renaming logic directly into the Swift application.
3. Added a menu bar interface with a toggle for enabling/disabling the file watching feature.
4. Improved logging for better debugging and issue tracking.
5. Updated the timestamp format to match the original shell script implementation.

## Current Functionality
- File system monitoring for Desktop, Documents, and a test directory.
- Automatic renaming of files ending with " copy" or matching a specific timestamp pattern.
- Toggle feature in the menu bar to enable/disable file watching.
- Logging of file system events and renaming operations.

## Known Issues
- The application may not be capturing all file creation events accurately.
- Logging output may not be visible in Xcode console during runtime.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and resolve issues with file creation event capturing.
2. Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
3. Add unit tests to ensure reliability of core functions.
4. Explore options for improving performance and reducing resource usage.
5. Consider adding user preferences for customizing watched directories and renaming patterns.

## Build and Run Instructions
1. Open the Xcode project file.
2. Ensure the AppDelegate.swift file contains the latest changes.
3. Build and run the application from Xcode.
4. The application should appear as an icon in the macOS menu bar.
5. Click the icon to access the toggle for enabling/disabling the file watching feature.
6. Test by creating copies of files in the watched directories (Desktop, Documents, and the specified test directory).

## Debugging Tips
- Enable verbose logging by modifying the `log` function in AppDelegate.swift.
- Use Xcode's Console view to monitor log output during runtime.
- Set breakpoints in key functions like `handleFileChange` and `renameFile` to step through the logic.

This summary reflects the current state of the DuplicateFileUpdater project as of the latest AppDelegate.swift implementation. Further testing and refinement may be necessary to ensure full functionality and reliability.
