# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Progress Summary - Version 2.8

## Current Status
The DuplicateFileUpdater project, a macOS menu bar application using Swift and AppKit, has made significant progress in addressing previous issues and improving overall functionality. However, some challenges remain in fully replicating the original shell script's behavior. Currently, the app only works in the Desktop folder and not in the Documents folder.

## Recent Changes and Improvements
1. Refined security-scoped bookmark implementation for more reliable folder access.
2. Improved file renaming logic to handle edge cases and prevent duplicate renames.
3. Expanded test suite to cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases.
4. Optimized file system monitoring for better performance and reduced resource usage.
5. Enhanced error handling and logging for easier debugging and issue resolution.

## Current Functionality
- Application builds and runs without compilation errors.
- Menu bar interface with toggle for enabling/disabling file watching.
- Robust file system monitoring using DispatchSource for the Desktop folder only.
- Improved permission handling with refined security-scoped bookmarks.
- Enhanced file renaming logic that better handles various file naming patterns.
- Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities for easier troubleshooting.

## Known Issues
1. Some edge cases in file renaming still need further refinement.
2. Occasional discrepancies between app behavior and original shell script implementation in specific scenarios.
3. The app currently does not work in the Documents folder as intended.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and resolve the issue preventing functionality in the Documents folder.
2. Continue refining file renaming logic to handle all possible edge cases.
3. Conduct extensive real-world testing to identify and address any remaining discrepancies with the original shell script.
4. Implement user preferences for customizing file watching behavior and renaming patterns.
5. Consider adding a feature to allow users to specify additional folders to watch.
6. Explore possibilities for improving performance and reducing resource usage further.

## Conclusion
Version 2.8 of the DuplicateFileUpdater represents significant progress towards a fully functional macOS application that replicates and improves upon the original shell script. While some challenges remain, particularly the limitation to the Desktop folder, the project is moving closer to achieving its goals of providing a user-friendly, efficient, and reliable solution for managing duplicate files. Resolving the Documents folder functionality will be a key focus for the next update.
