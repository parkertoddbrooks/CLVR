# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Progress Summary - Version 2.7

## Current Status
The DuplicateFileUpdater project, a macOS menu bar application using Swift and AppKit, has undergone further development but still faces challenges in achieving full functionality compared to the original shell script implementation.

## Recent Changes and Improvements
1. Implemented security-scoped bookmarks for improved folder access.
2. Fixed compilation errors in the `renameFile` function.
3. Enhanced logging capabilities and added a debug mode for better issue diagnosis.
4. Developed a basic test suite to validate core functionality against the original shell script.

## Current Functionality
- Application builds and runs without compilation errors.
- Menu bar interface with toggle for enabling/disabling file watching.
- File system monitoring using DispatchSource for Desktop and Documents folders.
- Improved permission handling with security-scoped bookmarks.
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities.

## Known Issues
1. File renaming still not functioning as expected for duplicated files.
2. Potential discrepancies between app behavior and original shell script implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct thorough testing of file detection and renaming logic.
2. Refine security-scoped bookmark implementation if necessary.
3. Expand test suite for comprehensive coverage of various scenarios.
4. Investigate any remaining permission or sandboxing issues.
5. Optimize performance and resource usage of file system monitoring.

## Conclusion
While progress has been made in addressing previous issues, further work is needed to ensure the application fully replicates the functionality of the original shell script while maintaining a user-friendly interface and efficient performance.
