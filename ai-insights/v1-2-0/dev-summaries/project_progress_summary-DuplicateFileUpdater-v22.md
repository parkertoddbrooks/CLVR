# Project Progress Summary: DuplicateFileUpdater v2.2.0

## Overview
The DuplicateFileUpdater project has undergone significant refactoring, transitioning from a multi-component system to a more integrated macOS menu bar application. This summary outlines the current status, recent changes, and the next steps for development.

## Current Status

1. Menu Bar Application (DuplicateTimestampMenuBar):
   - Implemented in Swift using AppKit for menu bar functionality.
   - Provides a toggle interface for the Duplicate + Timestamp feature.
   - Uses SF Symbols for dynamic icon representation.
   - Implements a subtle wiggle animation for user feedback.

2. Core Functionality:
   - Basic menu bar integration and UI interactions are in place.
   - Toggle functionality for enabling/disabling the feature is implemented.
   - Core file duplication and timestamping logic still needs to be integrated.

3. User Interface:
   - Custom menu with toggle switch and quit option.
   - Dynamic icon updates based on feature state.
   - Subtle animation feedback when toggling the feature.

4. Project Structure:
   - Consolidated into a single Swift application.
   - Removed dependency on separate Automator app and shell scripts.

## Recent Changes

1. Refactored to use AppKit instead of SwiftUI for better menu bar integration.
2. Implemented dynamic icon updates with SF Symbols.
3. Added a subtle wiggle animation for improved user feedback.
4. Set default state to enabled with a white icon on app launch.

## Next Steps

1. File System Integration:
   - Implement a native file watching mechanism to replace fswatch dependency.
   - Integrate FileKit or a similar library for file system operations.

2. Core Functionality Implementation:
   - Port the logic from DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh and DuplicateFileManager.sh to Swift.
   - Implement file duplication and timestamping directly in the app.

3. User Interface Enhancements:
   - Develop a first-launch setup wizard for user onboarding.
   - Implement more detailed controls and status information in the menu.

4. Security and Permissions:
   - Implement necessary entitlements for file system access.
   - Add logic to request and manage security-scoped bookmarks for monitored directories.

5. Error Handling and User Feedback:
   - Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
   - Provide clear, user-friendly notifications for various app states and actions.

6. App Store Compatibility:
   - Ensure all functionalities work within sandbox restrictions.
   - Optimize for Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

7. Testing and Optimization:
   - Conduct thorough testing on various macOS versions and configurations.
   - Optimize file monitoring for performance and battery efficiency.

8. Documentation and User Guide:
   - Update all documentation to reflect the new unified app structure.
   - Create a comprehensive user guide for the new features and setup process.

## Conclusion
The DuplicateFileUpdater project has made significant progress in consolidating its architecture and improving its user interface. The focus now shifts to implementing core functionality, enhancing security, and ensuring a smooth user experience. By addressing the next steps outlined above, we aim to create a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for file duplication and timestamping on macOS.
