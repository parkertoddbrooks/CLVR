# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Progress Summary - Version 2.5

## Current Status
The DuplicateFileUpdater project, implemented as a macOS menu bar application using Swift and AppKit, has undergone significant improvements in its file system monitoring approach and renaming logic. The application has been refactored to more closely match the functionality of the original shell script while maintaining the benefits of a GUI interface.

## Key Components
1. AppDelegate: Manages the application's main functionality and menu bar interface.
2. FileSystemWatcher: Implements file system monitoring using DispatchSourceFileSystemObject.
3. ToggleView: Custom view for the menu bar item's toggle switch.

## Recent Changes and Improvements
1. Refactored FileSystemWatcher to use DispatchSourceFileSystemObject for more efficient file system monitoring.
2. Updated the file detection logic to more accurately identify newly created files.
3. Improved the renaming logic to better match the original shell script functionality.
4. Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the application.
5. Streamlined the process of starting and stopping file watching.

## Current Functionality
- Application builds and runs without errors.
- Menu bar interface with a toggle for enabling/disabling the file watching feature.
- File system monitoring for Desktop and Documents folders.
- Accurate detection of newly created files.
- Renaming of duplicated files with timestamps, closely matching the original shell script behavior.
- Improved logging and error handling.

## Known Issues
- The application has not been extensively tested with a wide variety of file types and edge cases.
- There may be potential performance implications for directories with a large number of files.

## Next Steps
1. Thorough testing:
   - Test with various file types and naming conventions.
   - Perform stress tests with large numbers of files and rapid file creation.

2. Performance optimization:
   - Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks.
   - Optimize file system monitoring and renaming operations if necessary.

3. User feedback implementation:
   - Add more detailed user notifications for important events.
   - Consider implementing a log viewer within the application.

4. Code refinement:
   - Review and refactor code for improved readability and maintainability.
   - Consider breaking down large functions into smaller, more focused ones.

5. Documentation:
   - Update inline code documentation.
   - Create user documentation explaining the application's features and usage.

6. Possible feature additions:
   - Allow users to customize watched folders.
   - Implement a whitelist/blacklist for file types to be renamed.

## Build and Run Instructions
1. Open the Xcode project file.
2. Build and run the application from Xcode.
3. The application should appear as an icon in the macOS menu bar.
4. Click the icon to access the toggle for enabling/disabling the file watching feature.
5. Test by creating copies of files in the watched directories (Desktop and Documents).

## Debugging Tips
- Use breakpoints in key functions like FileSystemWatcher's checkForNewFiles and AppDelegate's renameFile.
- Monitor the console output for detailed logging information.
- Use Xcode's Instruments tool to profile the application for performance issues.

This summary reflects the current state of the DuplicateFileUpdater project as of version 2.5. The focus for the next phase of development should be on thorough testing, performance optimization, and user experience improvements.
