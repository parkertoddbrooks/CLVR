# DuplicateFileUpdater Project Progress Summary - Version 2.6

## Current Status
The DuplicateFileUpdater project, implemented as a macOS menu bar application using Swift and AppKit, has undergone several iterations to improve its functionality and user experience. However, despite these improvements, the app is still not functioning as expected when compared to the original shell script implementation.

## Recent Changes and Improvements
1. Refactored the `FileSystemWatcher` class to use `DispatchSourceFileSystemObject` for more efficient file system monitoring.
2. Updated the file detection logic to more accurately identify newly created files.
3. Improved the renaming logic to better match the original shell script functionality.
4. Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the application.
5. Streamlined the process of starting and stopping file watching.
6. Replaced the file browser dialog for permission requests with a simple `NSAlert` dialog, improving user experience.

## Current Functionality
- Application builds and runs without errors.
- Menu bar interface with a toggle for enabling/disabling the file watching feature.
- File system monitoring for Desktop and Documents folders using DispatchSource.
- Improved permission request dialog using NSAlert.
- Logging functionality for debugging purposes.

## Known Issues
1. The app is not functioning as expected when compared to the shell script implementation.
2. File renaming does not occur when files are duplicated on the Desktop or in the Documents folder.

## Potential Areas to Explore
1. File System Events:
   - Verify that the DispatchSource is correctly capturing file system events.
   - Implement more detailed logging of captured events to understand what's being detected.

2. File Detection:
   - Review the `checkForNewFiles` method to ensure it's correctly identifying new files.
   - Consider implementing a more robust method of tracking new files, possibly using a combination of creation dates and file hashes.

3. Renaming Logic:
   - Double-check the `renameFile` function to ensure it matches the logic in the shell script exactly.
   - Implement more detailed logging within this function to track its execution path.

4. Permissions:
   - Verify that the app has the necessary permissions to access and modify files in the watched directories.
   - Implement a check to confirm if permissions were actually granted after the user clicks "Grant Access".

5. Sandboxing:
   - Investigate if App Sandbox restrictions are preventing the app from accessing or modifying files.
   - Review entitlements and ensure they're correctly set for file access.

6. Asynchronous Operations:
   - Ensure that file operations are being performed on appropriate dispatch queues to prevent blocking the main thread.

7. Debugging:
   - Implement more comprehensive logging throughout the application.
   - Consider adding debug UI elements to display real-time information about file system events and app state.

8. Testing:
   - Develop a suite of unit and integration tests to verify each component of the app.
   - Create specific test scenarios that mimic the functionality of the shell script for direct comparison.

## Next Steps
1. Implement detailed logging for each step of the file detection and renaming process.
2. Create a debug mode that provides real-time feedback on file system events and app actions.
3. Verify file system permissions and implement a robust permission checking mechanism.
4. Review and possibly refactor the FileSystemWatcher class to ensure it's capturing all relevant events.
5. Implement a test suite that covers various file duplication scenarios.
6. Consider creating a simple command-line Swift tool that mimics the shell script functionality as a stepping stone to full GUI app implementation.

## Conclusion
While significant progress has been made in terms of app structure and user interface, the core functionality of detecting and renaming duplicated files is not yet working as expected. The focus for the next phase of development should be on debugging the file system watching and renaming logic, with an emphasis on replicating the exact behavior of the original shell script. Implementing more detailed logging and creating a comprehensive test suite will be crucial in identifying and resolving the current issues.
