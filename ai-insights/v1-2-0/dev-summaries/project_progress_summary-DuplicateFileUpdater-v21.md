# Duplicate File Updater - Project Progress Summary (v21)

## Overview
The Duplicate File Updater has evolved from a command-line tool to a macOS menu bar application using AppKit. This transition provides a more user-friendly interface and easier access to the file duplication and timestamp functionality.

## Key Changes and Features

### 1. Menu Bar Integration
- Implemented a status item in the menu bar using NSStatusItem.
- Custom icon using SF Symbols ('doc.on.doc' and 'doc.on.doc.fill') to represent enabled/disabled states.

### 2. User Interface
- Transitioned from SwiftUI to AppKit for better control over menu bar functionality.
- Custom dropdown menu with:
  - 'Duplicate + Timestamp' toggle switch
  - Separator
  - 'Quit' option

### 3. Toggle Functionality
- Implemented a custom ToggleView class (NSView subclass) for the menu item.
- Toggle switch controls the enabled/disabled state of the feature.

### 4. AppKit Implementation
- Utilizing NSStatusItem, NSMenu, and custom NSView subclasses for UI components.
- AppDelegate class manages the application's lifecycle and menu bar functionality.

### 5. Dynamic Icon Updates
- Icon changes based on the toggle state:
  - 'doc.on.doc' when disabled
  - 'doc.on.doc.fill' when enabled
- Implemented in the updateStatusItemIcon() method

### 6. App Behavior
- Runs as a true menu bar app without appearing in the Dock.
- Uses NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory) to hide from the Dock.

### 7. Code Structure
- AppDelegate class manages core functionality and UI.
- Separate DuplicateTimestampMenuBarApp class for app initialization.

### 8. Functionality Preparation
- Placeholder duplicateAndTimestamp() method ready for implementation of file operations.

## Current Status
- Fully functional menu bar application with toggle switch for feature activation.
- Dynamic icon updates reflect the current state of the feature.
- UI and basic interactions are complete and behaving correctly.
- Core file duplication and timestamp functionality still needs implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the file duplication and timestamp logic in the duplicateAndTimestamp() method.
2. Add error handling and user feedback for file operations.
3. Implement settings persistence to remember the toggle state between app launches.
4. Consider adding preferences for customizing timestamp format or other options.
5. Conduct thorough testing on different macOS versions and with various file types.
6. Address potential UI inconsistencies, particularly with the toggle switch behavior.
7. Optimize performance, especially for large file operations.
8. Enhance the UI with animations or additional visual feedback, if appropriate.

## Conclusion
Version 21 of the Duplicate File Updater represents a significant evolution in the application's architecture and user interface. The transition to a menu bar application using AppKit has laid a solid foundation for a native macOS experience. With the core UI and interactions in place, the focus can now shift to implementing the critical file duplication and timestamping functionality, as well as refining the user experience based on testing and feedback.
