# Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp - Development Summary (v14)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp is a macOS utility designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. This update focuses on finalizing the installer package and addressing installation issues.

## Recent Progress

### Installer Package Development
1. Created a build_package.sh script to generate a .pkg installer.
2. Updated the installer to include both scripts (DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh and DuplicateFileManager.sh) and the Automator app (DuplicateWithTimestamp.app).
3. Modified installation paths to align with previous setup:
   - Scripts now install to ~/.local/bin/
   - App installs to /Applications/
4. Added postinstall script to handle PATH updates and permissions.

### Troubleshooting
1. Addressed issues with package creation and file locations.
2. Investigated problems with double-clicking the installer package.
3. Verified package contents using pkgutil.

## Current Status

### What's Working
1. Package creation process (build_package.sh) successfully generates a .pkg file.
2. Package contains all necessary components (scripts and app).
3. Installation via command line (sudo installer -pkg) works correctly.

### Pending Issues
1. Double-clicking the .pkg file doesn't initiate installation (likely due to macOS security features).
2. App signing and notarization process not yet implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Implement app signing process using an Apple Developer ID.
2. Explore app notarization for enhanced security and easier installation.
3. Consider alternative distribution methods if signing/notarization is not feasible:
   - Create a DMG file with drag-and-drop installation.
   - Provide a shell script for easy installation.
4. Update documentation to reflect the latest installation process.
5. Conduct thorough testing on clean macOS systems to ensure proper installation and functionality.

## Conclusion
The Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp project has made significant progress in creating a comprehensive installer package. The core functionality is stable and working as intended. The focus now is on refining the installation process to make it more user-friendly and compatible with macOS security features. Future efforts will concentrate on app signing, notarization, and possibly exploring alternative distribution methods to ensure a smooth installation experience for end-users.
