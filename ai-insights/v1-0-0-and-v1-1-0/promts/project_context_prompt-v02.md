We are working on a project called "Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp" located at:
/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-name-with-timestamp-sh

The project is currently experiencing an issue with loading the launch agent. When attempting to load the plist file, we encounter the following error:

"Load failed: 5: Input/output error"

When using sudo, the system suggests:
"Try running `launchctl bootstrap` as root for richer errors."

Please read and analyze the following files in order:

1. README.md - This contains the project overview, features, installation instructions, and usage guide.
2. rename_duplicate.sh - This is the main shell script that implements the file renaming functionality.
3. com.user.fswatchrename.plist - This is the launchd plist file for running the script as a background process.

After reading these files, please review the latest error logs located in the /ai-insights/error-logs/ directory, particularly focusing on any logs related to launchd or plist loading issues.

Based on these files and the error information, please provide:
1. A brief summary of the project's purpose and main features.
2. The current implementation details, including the script's functionality and how it's set up to run automatically.
3. An analysis of the potential causes for the "Input/output error" when loading the launch agent.
4. Suggestions for troubleshooting steps or potential solutions to resolve the launchd loading issue.

Please note that this project focuses on a shell script implementation for renaming duplicate files with timestamps. The key challenge we're facing is getting the launch agent to load properly so the script can run automatically in the background.

After analyzing these files and the error context, you should be prepared to assist with debugging the launch agent loading issue and suggest potential fixes or workarounds.
