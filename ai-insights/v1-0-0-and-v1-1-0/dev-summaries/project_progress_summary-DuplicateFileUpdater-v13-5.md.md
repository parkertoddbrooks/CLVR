# Duplicate File Updater - Installer Project Summary

## Objective
Create an installer package for the Duplicate File Updater scripts, which automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps on macOS.

## Components
1. DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh: Main script for monitoring and renaming files.
2. DuplicateFileManager.sh: Script for managing the file monitoring service.

## Installer Goals
1. Package the scripts into a standard macOS installer (.pkg file).
2. Ensure proper installation of scripts to /usr/local/bin.
3. Set correct permissions for the installed scripts.
4. Provide a user-friendly installation experience.

## Challenges Encountered
1. Packaging individual scripts rather than a standard macOS application bundle.
2. Configuring pkgbuild and productbuild correctly for non-bundle content.
3. Balancing between creating a flat package and a bundle-style package.

## Current Approach
Using a combination of pkgbuild (for component package creation) and productbuild (for final installer package creation) to build a .pkg installer that will:
1. Copy the scripts to the correct location.
2. Set appropriate permissions.
3. Provide a standard macOS installation interface.

## Next Steps
1. Refine the build_package.sh script to successfully create the installer.
2. Test the installer on a clean macOS system.
3. Create or update installation scripts (preinstall/postinstall) as needed.
4. Consider simplifying the approach if packaging continues to present challenges.

## Alternative Considerations
1. Creating a simple shell script for installation instead of a .pkg file.
2. Distributing scripts with manual installation instructions.
3. Creating a DMG file with scripts and instructions.

The goal is to provide an easy and reliable way for users to install and use the Duplicate File Updater on their macOS systems.
