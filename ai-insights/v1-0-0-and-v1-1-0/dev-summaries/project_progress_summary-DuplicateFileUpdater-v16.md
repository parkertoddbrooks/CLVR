# Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp - Development Summary (v16)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp is a macOS utility designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. This update focuses on improving documentation, enhancing the installation process, and planning for future features.

## Recent Progress

### Documentation Improvements
1. Created a comprehensive troubleshooting guide (troubleshooting-v02.md) for both app and CLI versions.
2. Updated the CLI installation guide (cli-install.md) with clearer instructions.
3. Revised the version history (v02.md) to reflect recent changes and improvements.
4. Created a detailed directory structure document (dirstructure.md) for better project navigation.

### Installation and Setup
1. Refined the setup process for both the Automator app and CLI versions.
2. Improved error handling and logging during the installation process.
3. Added checks to prevent duplicate PATH entries during CLI setup.

### Future Feature Planning
1. Created a todo list for implementing a control bar icon, code signing, and notarization.
2. Outlined steps for enhancing the app's visibility and user interaction through a menu bar icon.
3. Planned for code signing and notarization to improve app security and distribution.

## Current Status

### What's Working
1. Both Automator app and CLI versions are functional for file duplication and renaming.
2. Installation processes for app and CLI versions are streamlined and more user-friendly.
3. Improved documentation provides better guidance for both users and developers.

### Pending Issues
1. Implementation of the control bar icon for easier app management.
2. Code signing and notarization processes need to be set up.
3. Some minor refinements in error handling and edge cases may be needed.
