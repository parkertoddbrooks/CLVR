# Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp - Development Summary (v10)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp is a macOS service designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. This update focuses on resolving installation issues and debugging the core functionality.

## Recent Progress

### Installation Process
1. Simplified the install.sh script to focus on essential tasks.
2. Created a new install2.sh script with improved error handling and file checks.
3. Successfully resolved the "cp: : No such file or directory" error.

### Automator Integration
1. Confirmed that the Automator app successfully starts and stops the service.
2. System alerts are properly triggered when the service is toggled.

## Current Status

### What's Working
1. Installation process: The new install2.sh script correctly copies DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh and DuplicateFileManager.sh to ~/.local/bin/ and makes them executable.
2. Automator app: Successfully starts and stops the service, triggering system alerts.

### What's Not Working
1. Core Functionality: The actual file duplication detection and renaming process is not functioning as expected.

## Potential Issues
1. File Monitoring: Possible issues with fswatch usage or directory path specifications.
2. Permissions: The script may lack necessary permissions to monitor or modify files.
3. Script Logic: Potential errors in DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh preventing correct file identification or renaming.
4. Environment Variables: Possible missing or incorrect environment variables when run through Automator.
5. Debugging Output: Lack of robust logging may be hiding the source of the problem.
6. fswatch Installation: Potential issues with fswatch installation or PATH settings.
7. Background Process Management: DuplicateFileManager.sh might not be correctly managing the DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh process.

## Next Steps

1. Review DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh:
   - Verify file monitoring setup (fswatch usage).
   - Check file paths for monitored directories.
   - Ensure renaming logic is correct.

2. Enhance Logging in DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh:
   - Add detailed logging at each step of the process.
   - Log file creation events, renaming attempts, and any errors encountered.
   - Ensure log file is written to an accessible location (e.g., ~/.local/log/).

3. Verify fswatch Installation:
   - Check if fswatch is installed: `which fswatch`
   - Ensure it's in the system PATH.
   - Test fswatch functionality independently of the script.

4. Check Permissions:
   - Verify that the script has read/write permissions in monitored directories.
   - Check if script runs correctly with elevated permissions (if needed).

5. Test DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh Manually:
   - Run the script directly from the command line.
   - Monitor its output and behavior.
   - Compare its functionality when run manually vs. through Automator.

6. Review DuplicateFileManager.sh:
   - Ensure it's correctly starting and managing DuplicateWithTimestamp.sh as a background process.
   - Add logging to track when it starts and stops the main script.

7. Automator App Review:
   - Verify that the Automator app is calling DuplicateFileManager.sh correctly.
   - Check if any environment variables need to be set explicitly in the Automator app.

8. Implement Error Handling:
   - Add try-catch blocks or error checking mechanisms in critical sections of the scripts.
   - Ensure all potential error scenarios are logged and handled gracefully.

9. Create Test Cases:
   - Develop a set of test cases that cover various file duplication scenarios.
   - Create a test script to automate these cases and verify the results.

10. Consider Alternate File Monitoring Methods:
    - If fswatch continues to be problematic, research alternative methods for file system monitoring on macOS.

By systematically working through these steps, we should be able to identify and resolve the issues preventing the core functionality from working correctly. Each step should be documented, and any changes should be tested thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce new issues.
