# Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp - Development Summary (v06)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp is a shell script tool designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. The latest update focuses on troubleshooting issues with the launch agent and improving the overall reliability of the automated background process.

## Key Features
1. Monitors specified directories (Desktop and Documents) for file duplication events
2. Automatically renames duplicated files with timestamps
3. Handles multiple duplications by appending additional timestamps
4. Works with files ending in " copy" (case insensitive) or files already renamed by this script
5. Provides options for running as a background process using launchd

## Implementation Details

### Shell Script Version
- Located in: `/usr/local/bin/rename_duplicate.sh`
- Dependencies: fswatch (system utility)
- Uses `fswatch` for file system monitoring
- Utilizes bash scripting for file renaming logic
- Monitors the user's Desktop and Documents folders by default

## Automated Startup
- Includes a Launch Agent (`com.user.fswatchrename.plist`) for automatic startup on macOS
- Currently experiencing issues with loading the launch agent

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md file providing:
  - Project overview and features
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Instructions for running as a background process
  - Troubleshooting tips

## Recent Updates (v06)
1. Troubleshooting launch agent loading issues
2. Updated plist file to include EnvironmentVariables for PATH
3. Added debug logging to the shell script for better error tracking
4. Explored various launchctl commands for loading and debugging the launch agent
5. Created new project context prompts to facilitate troubleshooting

## Current Challenges
1. Launch agent fails to load with "Input/output error"
2. Investigating potential causes such as permissions, file locations, and system configurations

## Development Process
1. Iterative troubleshooting of the launch agent loading issue
2. Refined plist file configuration
3. Enhanced error logging and debugging capabilities
4. Explored alternative methods for running the script as a background process

## Future Steps
1. Resolve the launch agent loading issue
2. Implement robust error handling and reporting in the shell script
3. Consider alternative methods for background execution if launchd issues persist
4. Enhance documentation with troubleshooting steps and common error resolutions
5. Conduct thorough testing across various macOS versions and configurations

## Conclusion
While the core functionality of the Duplicate File and Update Name with Timestamp tool remains solid, we are currently focused on resolving issues related to running the script as a background process via launchd. This challenge highlights the complexities of system integration on macOS. Moving forward, we will continue to investigate the root cause of the launch agent loading error and explore alternative solutions to ensure reliable background execution of our file renaming utility.
