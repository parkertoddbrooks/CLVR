# Duplicate File Updater - Development Summary (v03)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File Updater is a tool designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. It provides both Python and shell script implementations to cater to different user preferences and system requirements. The latest update focuses on enhancing the shell script version to improve its reliability and correct file renaming behavior.

## Key Features
1. Monitors specified directories (Desktop and Documents) for file duplication events
2. Renames duplicated files with timestamps
3. Handles multiple duplications by appending additional timestamps
4. Works with files ending in " copy" (case insensitive) or files already renamed by this script
5. Provides both Python and shell script versions for flexibility
6. Improved error handling and retry mechanism for file operations

## Implementation Details

### Python Version
- Located in: `/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-with-time/python/`
- Main script: `duplicate_file_updater.py`
- Dependencies: watchdog (specified in `requirements.txt`)
- Uses `watchdog` library for file system monitoring
- Implements a custom `FileSystemEventHandler` for event handling

### Shell Script Version
- Located in: `/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-with-time/shell-script/`
- Main script: `rename_duplicate.sh`
- Dependencies: fswatch (system utility)
- Uses `fswatch` for file system monitoring
- Utilizes bash scripting for file renaming logic
- Monitors the user's Desktop and Documents folders
- Implements a retry mechanism for handling rapid file system events

## Automated Startup
- Created a Launch Agent (`com.user.fswatchrename.plist`) for automatic startup on macOS login
- Instructions for installation and usage of the Launch Agent included in the installation guide

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md file providing:
  - Project overview and features
  - Links to separate installation guides for Python and shell script versions
  - Usage examples for both versions
  - FAQ section comparing Python and shell script versions
  - Information on macOS compatibility (developed for macOS Sonoma 14.5)
  - MIT License inclusion
- Separate installation guides:
  - `installation-python.md` for Python version
  - `installation-shell-script.md` for shell script version

## Development Process
1. Initial implementation of the Python version
2. Creation of the shell script version for Unix-based systems
3. Directory structure organization for clear separation of versions
4. README creation and iterative improvements
5. Implementation of automated startup capability for macOS
6. Enhancement of shell script to monitor Desktop and Documents folders
7. Continuous refinement based on user feedback and testing

## Recent Updates (v03)
1. Improved error handling in the shell script version:
   - Implemented a retry mechanism to handle "file does not exist" errors
   - Added a max attempt limit (3 attempts with 1-second delay between each)
2. Fixed logic for renaming subsequent duplicates:
   - Correctly identifies files that already have a timestamp
   - Appends new timestamps with "--" separator for multiple duplications
   - Removed extra "copy" text from filenames of subsequent duplications
3. Enhanced debug logging for better troubleshooting
4. Updated installation and usage instructions for the shell script version

## Future Enhancements
1. Cross-platform testing and adaptation
2. GUI implementation for easier configuration
3. Additional customization options for renaming patterns
4. Integration with cloud storage services for wider applicability

## Conclusion
The Duplicate File Updater project continues to evolve, with the latest update (v03) focusing on improving the reliability and correctness of the shell script version. By implementing a retry mechanism and fixing the renaming logic for multiple duplications, we've addressed key issues reported by users. The project maintains its dual implementation approach, catering to both Python enthusiasts and shell script users, while ensuring flexibility and wider usability across different system configurations. Moving forward, we will continue to refine the tool based on user feedback and explore new features to enhance its functionality.
