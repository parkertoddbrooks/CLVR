# Duplicate File Updater - Development Summary (v02)

## Project Overview
The Duplicate File Updater is a tool designed to automatically rename duplicated files with timestamps. It provides both Python and shell script implementations to cater to different user preferences and system requirements. The latest update focuses on enhancing the shell script version to monitor the user's entire home directory by default.

## Key Features
1. Monitors specified directories for file duplication events
2. Renames duplicated files with timestamps
3. Handles multiple duplications by appending additional timestamps
4. Works with files ending in " copy" (case insensitive) or files already renamed by this script
5. Provides both Python and shell script versions for flexibility
6. Shell script version now monitors the user's home directory by default

## Implementation Details

### Python Version
- Located in: `/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-with-time/python/`
- Main script: `duplicate_file_updater.py`
- Dependencies: watchdog (specified in `requirements.txt`)
- Uses `watchdog` library for file system monitoring
- Implements a custom `FileSystemEventHandler` for event handling

### Shell Script Version
- Located in: `/Users/parker/Documents/dev/claude-engineer/_Projects/duplicate-file-and-update-with-time/shell-script/`
- Main script: `rename_duplicate.sh`
- Dependencies: fswatch (system utility)
- Uses `fswatch` for file system monitoring
- Utilizes bash scripting for file renaming logic
- Now monitors the user's home directory by default, with option to specify a different directory

## Automated Startup
- Created a Launch Agent (`com.user.fswatchrename.plist`) for automatic startup on macOS login
- Updated to use the default home directory monitoring
- Instructions for installation and usage of the Launch Agent included in the installation guide

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md file providing:
  - Project overview and features
  - Links to separate installation guides for Python and shell script versions
  - Usage examples for both versions
  - FAQ section comparing Python and shell script versions
  - Information on macOS compatibility (developed for macOS Sonoma 14.5)
  - MIT License inclusion
- Separate installation guides:
  - `installation-python.md` for Python version
  - `installation-shell-script.md` for shell script version, updated with new default behavior

## Development Process
1. Initial implementation of the Python version
2. Creation of the shell script version for Unix-based systems
3. Directory structure organization for clear separation of versions
4. README creation and iterative improvements
5. Implementation of automated startup capability for macOS
6. Enhancement of shell script to monitor home directory by default
7. Continuous refinement based on user feedback and testing

## Recent Updates
1. Modified shell script to use user's home directory as default watch directory
2. Updated installation instructions for shell script version
3. Revised README to reflect new default behavior of shell script
4. Created separate installation guides for Python and shell script versions

## Future Enhancements
1. Cross-platform testing and adaptation
2. GUI implementation for easier configuration
3. Additional customization options for renaming patterns
4. Integration with cloud storage services for wider applicability

## Conclusion
The Duplicate File Updater project continues to evolve, with the latest update focusing on improving user experience for the shell script version. By setting the default monitoring to the user's home directory, we've made the tool more intuitive and easier to use out of the box. The project maintains its dual implementation approach, catering to both Python enthusiasts and shell script users, while ensuring flexibility and wider usability across different system configurations.
