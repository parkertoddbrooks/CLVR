# CLVR (klōvər)

CLVR (klōvər) - v2.0.0

A macOS utility that automatically renames duplicated files with timestamps.

App Process:
- Command-D on 'filename.file-extension' > 'filename copy.file-extension' renamed to 'filename--YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM-SS.file-extension'

Key features:
- Low impact background operations
- Visual feedback via animated menu bar icon
- Two timestamp formats
- On/Off toggle switch, and flexible app visibility (Dock, Menu Bar, or both)
- Preserves file extension, and works on hidden files
- Compatible with open at login preferences

Privacy Considerations:
- Only accesses and modifies files in user-selected folders
- File monitoring is limited to detecting changes for renaming purposes only
- No data is transmitted outside of the user's system

## AI-Assisted Development Insights

The project was developed with Claude Sonnet 3.5, ChatGPT 4o, Claude Engineer CLI, Cursor and Xcode. The `/ai_insight/` directory contains valuable information about this AI-assisted development approach:

### cli-dump
Complete transcripts of Claude Engineering CLI sessions.

### dev-summaries
Comprehensive project progress updates that allow any AI or developer to quickly understand the current state of the project. This serves as a continuity mechanism to preserve context beyond various model and system limitations, including token limits, context windows, session boundaries, rate limits, stateless API interactions, parsing complexities, and cross-model compatibility issues. 

### error-logs
CLI outputs for each encountered bug. These are submitted to Claude via Markdown files rather than direct paste to prevent formatting issues caused by multiple carriage returns. This method helps maintain Claude Engineer's stability when processing large blocks of text.

### PRDs
Product requirement documents generated by both OpenAI and Anthropic, outlining the specifications for this project or PRDs we for features we created as we developed the software.

### prompts
Prompts designed to efficiently bring Claude Engineering CLI back up to speed after any connection or context loss, ensuring continuity in the development process.

### steps
A continuously updated file containing Claude's recommendations for next steps in the project, providing a clear roadmap for development.
